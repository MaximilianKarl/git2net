Modules
=======

At its core, git2net provides three modulesâ€”`extraction`, `disambiguation`, and `visualisation`.


----------
Extraction
----------

The module `extraction` contains all the functions that operate directly on a git repository.
The most important functions in this module are:

    * **mine_git_repo**: mines edits from a locally cloned git repositry to an SQLite database.
    * **mine_github**: creates a local clone and mines edits from repository on GitHub to an SQLite database.
    * **check_mining_complete**: checks if a repository has been fully mined.
    * **mining_state_summary**: provides information on any commits that have not been fully mined.

Checkout the `API reference <https://git2net.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#module-git2net.extraction>`_ for information on the complete list of available functions.


--------------
Disambiguation
--------------

The module `disambiguation` only contains a single function which allows you to disambiguate author identities.
The disambiguation is based on the algorithm `gambit`_.

    * **disambiguate_aliases_db**: disambiguates author aliases in a database mined with git2net.


-------------
Visualisation
-------------

The `visualisation` module provides functions to generate various network projections based on the SQLite database created during the mining process.

    * **get_coediting_network**: creates a co-editing network where nodes are authors who are connected by a directed link if they consecutively edited the same line of code. Links are directed from the previous to the subsequent author.
    * **get_coauthorship_network**: creates a co-authorship network were nodes are authors who are connected by an undirected link if the edited the same file.
    * **get_bipartite_network**: creates a bipartite network with nodes representing authors and files. Undirected links exist between an author and all files the author edited.
    * **get_line_editing_paths**: creates paths for all lines in a repository. The paths contain ordered sequences of authors who subsequently edited a line. The number of paths generated for a line depends on the number of forks and merges the line was involved in.
    * **get_commit_editing_dag**: creates a directed acyclic graph where nodes are commits. Commits are connected by a directed link if a one commit modifies lines last editied in another commit. Links are directed from the editing commit to the edited commit.
